      briefIntroOne: `
     Hello there, I am a self-taught full-stack developer who has been learning by coding full-time via varieties of both paid and free resources online at home for five months. I have developed fairly good foundations with frontend technologies, and I am now able to build functional web applications as rewards. Currently I am learning backend technologies starting with Node.js and MongoDB after finishing working with JavaScript (ES6+), React, HTML5, CSS3 in the browser. 
        `,
      briefIntroTwo: `There is also an amount of hours I invested on computer fundamental knowledge such as Data Structure and Algorithms, Computer networks, Operating systems, and Databases. I aim to be a real software engineer rather than a developer who can only code but knowing nothing of what is happening under the hood. You can go to the About page to check what I have been learning , where I have been learning from so far in more detail, and my personal info by clicking the link below.  Thank you.`,

          p: `I am the kind of person who has lots of curiosities about the core, fundamental concepts of the things I want to learn and study. I believe that no comprehensive understanding of what is under the hood results in no good outcomes when trying to master a skill, and no exceptions can go through this natural principle. I have always been amazed and shocked how some tools, libraries, frameworks are built while coding in a higher level abstraction with them. Since I have been learning for roughly four months, I gradually lost interest in building something that people who know nothing about programming may be surprised of but really just few APIs are used. I am fully aware being a real software engineer isn’t about how many programming languages you know, what kind of applications you can build. Coding in higher level abstractions can’t bring much to oneself. With that being said, I decided to switch my concentration from ‘superstructure’ to ‘substrate’ such as Computer Architecture, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Algorithms and Data Structures. I don’t wanna be the person who never quite understood something like recursion, really. Of course I will still spend some time on frontend technologies but will be trying to build tools, simple wheels, not applications.`,

I said alright, without any further ado, I am gonna learn how to code. But how? Well, I picked up the cheapest and most challenging way: teaching myself. And, there was a further ado, I took a long break first (lol). It is really tough and difficult. There were many times I wanted to give it up. Thanks to myself, I have come this far, and I don’t mind going a little bit further. I will list all the skills I know and all resources I have used learning these skills from.
